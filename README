Renders LaTeX math formulas in Discord
Similar to the browser extension Katex-with-Slack, except this plugin is
for Discord.

Usage instructions:

Inline math:
\\( .. \\)
$ .. $

Display math:
\\[ .. \\]
$$ .. $$

Newline:
\newline

Blackboard bold letter shorthands:
\R is short for \mathbb{R}
\N is short for \mathbb{N}
\Z is short for \mathbb{Z}


Downloads:
Firefox: tba
Chrome: tba


Troubleshooting:

Common issues are caused by:
1.
Discord uses _ for _italics_ and * for *boldface*. This can interfere with your LaTeX formatting if your message
has multiple underscores or asterisks in it.

2.
Discord assigns special meaning to the backslash \

Solutions:
A.
play around with spacing, either adding or removing it
B.
Add extra backslashes to escape certain characters.
The rendering engine KaTeX ignores double backslashes, which should help here.


Build instructions:
$ make
